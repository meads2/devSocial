# DevBook 
A minimal jquery social media project for a class project

[Demo Site](http://project3.surge.sh/)

## Technolgies
- HTML5 localStorage API to have persistent storage of app data

## Functionality
- Allows a user to mock login, and updates navatar to user's initials
- Allows a user to vote on a poll, and saves vote to storage, to ensure they cannot vote twice

## Thoughts For Improvements
- Update the codebase to be more maintainable
- Adopt a design framework to bring more consistency to elements and components
- Add login validation to prevent login unless all fields are entered
- Enhance some designs
- Add responsiveness on smaller screens
- Make JavaScript more DRY and component based

## Bugs
- There are some bugs in this project and it is encouraged not to use any real credentials in login, use 'password' for password. As these are not stored on a secure database, but your computer which can be accessed by other websites and applications.
